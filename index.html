							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>
								Hello World! My name is Tina Tran, and I am a sophomore at the University of Central Florida’s Burnett Honors College studying Computer Science and Mathematics. Ever since I learned about Alpha Go in high school, I have been interested in learning more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This passion has been all the more fueled by the recent explosion of AI-related media due to ChatGPT.
							</p>
							<p>
								Oftentimes others comment on my insatiable thirst for knowledge as the main reason for the multitude of various involvement I have done. However, I believe  everything is only possible due to skills in time management, discipline, and perseverance I learned from my extracurricular activities. In addition, I have learned multiple computer languages when working on projects including Golang, SQL, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C as well as the PyTorch framework for Machine Learning. These skills will benefit me in my research career.
							</p>
							<p>
								My current goal is to pursue graduate school to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science. In my undergraduate career I plan on applying to multiple Research Opportunities for Undergraduates - including the REU offered by the Computer Vision Department at UCF - over the coming summers and the BS-to-MS Program at UCF to earn my Master’s in Computer Science and improve my chances of being accepted to to graduate school.

									<h3>Research</h3>
									<p>I am currently conducting research in the department of Mathematics with Dr. Carlos Borges in connecting Reinforcement Learning with the Inverse Scattering Problem. I also am developing a Honors Undergraduate Thesis with Dr. Rickard Ewetz in Machine Learning with music data.</p>

									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<p>As a computer science major, I also love to program. I am involved in many projects both in academics and outside. I have a leading role in the student-led Multus Medium, where we are developing a multimedia recommendation system. At my summer internship at Snap One, I worked on gathering data using SQL queries to develop a documentation website for all the events within the Rebase data lake. I also work on various personal projects in my spare time with my twin sister, another computer science student at UCF. One such project is coding this website with help from an HTML template!</p>

									<h3>Extracurricular</h3>
									<p>Outside of academics, I am an active Kung Fu student taking online lessons. I am a brown-belt studying the Mi Zhong Luo Han style, which is within the Northern Shaolin category of Kung Fu. I also play the trumpet, though currently I am taking a break to focus on academics.</p>

									<h2>Research</h2>
									<p>My forays into the field of research has shown me the wonders of exploring unknown territory. I very much enjoy learning about new topics and discovering new information. However, research is extremely time-consuming, and I found that results do not always follow a linear path. Nevertheless, conducting research is a joy no matter the outcome, for the hard work done to get the project done is reward enough.</p>

									<h2>Projects</h2>
									<p>Developing projects always involves time management and careful planning. Sometimes it involves task delegation and learning new skills. Being involved and producing these projects helps me to not only utilize and further develop the soft skills of self administration, but also learn hard skills such as new programming languages, libraries, and/or frameworks. In addition, these projects have involved getting help and/or working with a team of one or more people. Productive and efficient communication is necessary for smooth project development as well as in a research environment.</p>

									<h2>Extracurricular</h2>
									<p>Kung Fu helps me to become more fit physically and challenges me to develop skills in discipline for training. I am proud to see how far I have come from as a premature child with Asthma who started during sophomore year of high school to the brown-belt of today. Physical health is important to maintain to ensure a healthy career and I often utilize discipline outside of Kung Fu when juggling all my academic work and projects.  Kung Fu also has challenges to tackle such as trying to practice martial arts online via Zoom while attending school three hours away at UCF. Nevertheless, I try to practice little-by-little each day with hopes of one day earning my black belt.</p>
									<p>Playing the trumpet is a fun hobby that I enjoy. I learn the importance of hard work and discipline similar with Kung Fu. Both are activities where dedication and perseverance are key.</p>
