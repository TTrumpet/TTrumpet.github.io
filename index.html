				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hello World! My name is Tina Tran, and I am a graduate student at the University of Central Florida’s
					Burnett Honors College studying Computer Science towards a Master's degree.
					I received my BS in Computer Science from UCF and I am working towards my MS through the BS-to-MS program.
					Ever since I learned about the Go-playing Alpha	Go program in high school, 
					I have been interested in learning more about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). 
					This passion has been all the more fueled by the recent explosion of AI-related media due
					to the infamous ChatGPT. I aspire to become a researcher and push forward the frontier of human
					knowledge on computational techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oftentimes others comment on my insatiable thirst for knowledge as the main reason for the multitude
					of various involvement I have done. However, I believe everything is only possible due to skills in
					time management, discipline, and perseverance I learned from my extracurricular activities. I am a
					Kung Fu student and intermediate trumpet player, both activities that require time and effort to
					improve. In
					addition, I have learned multiple computer languages when working on projects including Golang, SQL,
					JavaScript, Java, Python, and C as well as the PyTorch framework for Machine Learning and
					rudimentary MATLAB.
					These skills grown through my experiences
					will benefit me in my research career to avoid burnout and succeed at a technical level.
				</p>
				<p>
					My current goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science. More specifically,
					I would like to explore Computer Vision. I am currently
					conducting research in the Computer Vision field to improve the perception of visual language models.
					I am also in the ML field studying reinforcement learning to solve the inverse scattering
					problem to optimize sensor placement in image reconstruction. I recently completed an undergraduate
					honors thesis on using transformers to create a scalable
					and efficient music recommendation system. 
					In my undergraduate career, I was part of a group that won second place in The Perception Test Challenge
					2024 on the Grounded-Video Question-Answering Task sponsored by Google DeepMind. I presented this work at
					ECCV 2024 at Milan, Italy. I was accepted into the
					BS-to-MS Program at UCF to earn my Master’s in Computer Science and I plan to go on to graduate school after I graduate
					in Spring 2024. In my future career, I hope to make impactful contributions in
					creating emerging
					technology in the AI sphere.

						<h3>Research</h3>
						<p>I am currently conducting research as a member of the Center for Research in Computer Vision under Dr. Mubarak Shah.
							My research topis is LLMs / VLMs.
							I am also in the department of Mathematics with Dr. Carlos Borges in
							connecting Reinforcement Learning with the Inverse Scattering Problem. I have completed
							a Honors Undergraduate Thesis with Dr. Rickard Ewetz in Machine Learning with music data.

						<h3>Projects</h3>
						<p>I am involved in projects both in academics and outside.
							I was a ML Fellow in the Break Through Tech AI Virtual Program, working in a small group with LatitudeAI 
							to research Bird's Eye View state-of-the-art research for autonomous vehicles.
							I led a team in developing a multimedia recommendation system.
							At my summer internship at Snap One, I used SQL queries to develop a documentation website
							for the Rebase data lake events.
							I also work on personal projects with my twin sister, another CS student at UCF.
							I coded this website using an HTML template.</p>

						<h3>Extracurricular</h3>
						<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy exercise as a former Kung Fu brown-belt student of the the Mi Zhong Luo Han style, 
							which is within the Northern Shaolin category of Kung Fu. 
							I also enjoy playing and writing music; I play the trumpet and electric bass.</p>

						<h2>Research</h2>
						<p>My forays into the field of research has shown me the wonders of exploring unknown territory.
							I very much enjoy learning about new topics and discovering new information. However,
							research is extremely time-consuming, and I found that results do not always follow a linear
							path. Nevertheless, conducting research is a joy no matter the outcome, for the hard work
							done to get the project done is reward enough.</p>

						<h2>Projects</h2>
						<p>Developing projects always involves time management and careful planning. Sometimes it
							involves task delegation and learning new skills. Being involved and producing these
							projects helps me to not only utilize and further develop the soft skills of self
							administration, but also learn hard skills such as new programming languages, libraries,
							and/or frameworks. In addition, these projects have involved getting help and/or working
							with a team of one or more people. Productive and efficient communication is necessary for
							smooth project development as well as in a research environment.</p>

						<h2>Extracurricular</h2>
						<p>Kung Fu has helped me to become more fit physically and challenges me to develop skills in
							discipline for training. I am proud to see how far I have come from as a premature child
							with Asthma who started during sophomore year of high school to the brown-belt of today.
							Physical health is important to maintain to ensure a healthy career and I often utilize
							discipline outside of Kung Fu when juggling my academic work and projects. 
							I try to practice little-by-little each day with hopes of one day earning my black belt.</p>
						<p>My musical hobbies of composition and playing the trumpet and bass are fun hobbies that I enjoy. 
							I learn the importance of hard work and	discipline similar with Kung Fu. 
							I also am able to tap into a creative side different to creativity within academics. 
							Both are activities where dedication and perseverance are key.</p>
