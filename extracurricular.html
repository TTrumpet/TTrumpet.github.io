				<h3>Kung Fu</h3>
				<p>I am a brown-belt Kung Fu student at Tang Martial Arts Center located in Bradenton, Florida. I study
					under my master, Sifu Leng Tang. I study the Mi Zhong Luo Han style, a Northern Shaolin Mi Zong
					branch which belongs to the “long-fist” Northern group of Kung Fu similar to Tai Chi, Pah Kwa, and
					Tan Tui. Mi Zhong Luo Han was first developed by Grand Master Ye Yu-Ting, alias Chuk-Chuan Ye, from
					the Chuong Hsien of Hopeh Provence in Northern China and was born in the times of Emperor Kwang Shui
					of the Ching Dynasty. This style of Kung Fu is characterized by the versatility of hand and foot
					movements which lead to fleeting footwork and nimble jumps.</p>
				<p> Below are the certificates for each belt I have earned thus far from newest to oldest.
					Note: Blue, Blue-Purple, and Purple-Brown belts are not shown.</p>

				<h3>Trumpet</h3>
				<p>I am a trumpet player who started in middle school, 7th grade (August 2017). I played in the Pine
					View Wind Ensemble in high school for three years and as a high school senior played first chair
					trumpet. At UCF, I have played in both the UCF Concert band and UCF University Band, each for one
					semester. Currently, I am taking a break to focus on academics.<br />
					I own and play a Silver Yamaha Student Model YTR-200ADII.</p>
				<p>I also enjoy learning and practicing music composition in my free time.</p>
